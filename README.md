General Requirements
Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques:
•	The application must be implemented using ASP.NET Core 2.1 framework.
o	The application must have at least 8 web pages (views)

•	Use Entity Framework Core to access your database
o	If you need additional connectors to other databases, feel free to use them
•	Use MVC areas to separate different parts of your application (e.g. area for administration)
•	Adapt the default ASP.NET Core site template or get another free theme
